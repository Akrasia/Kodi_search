# Wox installation:

This Wox plugin allows you to search your local Kodi library.

You MUST have "Allow remote control via HTTP" enabled for this plugin to work.
This option is found under: Settings > Services > Control

Wox can take some time to load depending on the size of your library. The plugin attempts to cache all thumbnails for movies and Tv Shows but Wox can be finicky about loading images at times.

At the moment some TV Shows do not return any episodes.
